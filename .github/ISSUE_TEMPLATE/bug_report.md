** Describe the bug: **

** Your configuration: **
- Weather station code:
- Pollen station code:

** Attach a DEBUG log of hass-swissweather integration. See https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#enabling-debug-logging **
The debug log has to contain at least one sync event with received data.

Issues without debug logs are very hard to debug and will be closed.
